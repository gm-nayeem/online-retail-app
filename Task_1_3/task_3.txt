Choice of Database: 
For a high-traffic web application with lots of people using it at the same time and a lot of interaction with the database, MongoDB is a good choice. Here are the key reasons for choosing this database:

Handles Many Users: MongoDB can handle a large number of people using your website simultaneously.
Adapts Easily: If you need to change how your data is organized, MongoDB makes it easy to adjust without causing issues.
Works Fast: MongoDB is fast, especially when you have a lot of people reading information from the database.
Community Support: Many developers use MongoDB, so there's a big community offering help, tutorials, and resources.

Handling High Concurrency and Load:
Caching Strategies: Leverage caching mechanisms to store frequently accessed data closer to the application, reducing the load on the database.
Load Balancing: Use load-balancing techniques to distribute incoming requests across multiple application instances. 

Optimization Techniques for NestJS: 
Optimize middleware by using only what is necessary for specific routes. Avoid unnecessary processing in middleware to improve response times. And optimize guards for efficient request validation and authorization.

Deployment Considerations:
Cloud Services: Deploy the application on cloud services like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud for simplified deployment and scalability.
Docker: Docker ensure consistent deployment across different environments. This facilitates scalability and easier management of dependencies.
CI/CD Pipelines: Implement CI/CD pipelines with tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions. Automate the testing and deployment process to ensure rapid and reliable releases.

NodeJS and NestJS Libraries/Tools:
Performance Monitoring: Use tools like New Relic or Datadog for performance monitoring. 
Profiling: Implement profiling tools like clinic.js to analyze and optimize the application's performance.

Bonus: Security Considerations:
Input Validation: Implement strict input validation to prevent common vulnerabilities like SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
Authentication and Authorization: Use secure authentication mechanisms like JWT and implement proper authorization to ensure that users have the appropriate permissions.
HTTPS: Enforce the use of HTTPS to secure data in transit.
Dependency Scanning: Regularly scan dependencies for security vulnerabilities using tools like Snyk or npm audit.
Code Reviews: Conduct regular code reviews to identify and fix security issues early in the development process.
